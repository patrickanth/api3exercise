write a Spring Boot application with the necessary dependencies that has:
a StringController that:
is mapped on strings
returns the concatenation of 2 strings (the first is mandatory, the second is not) params
handle the case where the second string is null (we want to return just the first string)
test the API endpoint with Postman, executing 2 GET requests:
with just the first param
with both the params
